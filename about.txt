hello there!
okay so i have the following in mind on learning a new skill "DevOps"
i expect to take up a maximum of six montths to fully perfect 
my plan is as follows

week    concept     software1      software2 
1       configure   Terraform       ansible
2       version     git             github+gitlab
3       package     docker          lambda
4       deploy      jenkins         codeDeploy
5       run         ECS             kubernets
6       Monitor     Elk-stack       prometheus

i have some background knowledge on git and Docker while the rest i'm green 

i shall be documenting the dates and the relevant skills aquired during this period 
in this same file as well as decorate my git hub account 

i shall also come up with a biolerplate code that i'll be using throughout the process 

i expect to be using vscodium as my editor because of its super cool features 


after this skill learning process i expect to be able to fully manage software solutions
and apply my PMP skills inorder to deliver creative and innovative software deliverables to whoever needss them 

may God help ME
